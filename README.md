## How Elo Rating Works

The Elo rating system calculates the relative skill levels of players or teams in competitive games. Key concepts:

1. **Expected Score**: Calculated based on the rating difference between competitors
2. **K-Factor**: Determines how much ratings change after each match
3. **Rating Adjustment**: Winners gain points, losers lose points, with draws splitting the difference
